defmodule GenRouterx do
  @moduledoc """
  A behaviour module for routing data from multiple sources
  to multiple sinks.

  `GenRouterx` allows developers to receive data from multiple
  sources and/or send data to multiple sinks. The relationship
  between sources (the one sending messages) and sinks (the one
  receiving them) is established when the sink explicitly asks
  for data.

  Since the same process can send and receive data, the same
  process can be both a source and sink, which is quite common.
  Sources that only send data and sinks that only receive data
  are called "definite source" and "definite sink", respectively.

  As an example, imagine the following processes A, B and C:

      [A] -> [B] -> [C]

  A is a source to B and B is a source to C. Similarly, C is a
  sink to B and B is a sink to A. A is a definite source, C is
  a definite sink.

  ## A broadcasting router

  As an example, let's implement a router that simplies
  broadcast all incoming events to all sinks. Its implementation
  is as follows:

      defmodule BroadcastRouter do
        use GenRouterx

        def start_link do
          GenRouterx.start_link(__MODULE__, %{})
        end

        def handle_up({pid, ref}, state) do
          {:ok, Map.put(state, ref, pid)}
        end

        def handle_down(_reason, {_pid, ref}, state) do
          {:ok, Map.delete(state, ref)}
        end

        def handle_dispatch(_event, state) do
          {:ok, Map.values(state), state}
        end
      end

  Our broadcast router implements 3 callbacks:

    * `handle_up/2` - it is invoked when a process asks the router
      to start receiving the data (i.e. become a sink). It receives
      the pid, the reference and the router state. The reference is
      the one sent by the sink and  `handle_up/3` is invoked only
      once per sink (until `handle_down/3` or `handle_overflow/2`
      are invoked) . In the implementation above, all we do is in
      `handle_up/2` is to store the new `ref` and `pid` pair in a map

    * `handle_down/3` - if `handle_up/2` returns an `:ok` tuple, the
      sink then is monitored. `handle_down/3` is called when the
      sink process dies or explicitly cancels its subscription

    * `handle_dispatch/2` - invoked everytime an event comes. It
      must return `{:ok, pids, state}`, where `pids` is a list of
      pids to dispatch the event to

  Let's give it a try on terminal:

      # Start the broadcast router
      iex> {:ok, pid} = BroadcastRouter.start_link()

      # Create a reference and use it to ask for data
      iex> ref = Process.monitor(pid)
      iex> GenRouterx.ask(pid, self(), ref, 10)

      # Finally broadcast something
      iex> GenRouterx.sync_notify(BroadcastRouter, :hello)

      # We have received it
      iex> flush()

  The first time we invoke `ask/4` for that given reference,
  it is registered in the router which will now send data.
  We have initially asked the router to send us 10 events.
  Once the 10 events are delivered, the router will buffer
  messages until we ask for more or until a customizable
  threshold is reached. It is possible to opt-out by calling
  `GenRouterx.cancel/2`.

  The underlying routing messages for routing, asking and
  cancelling are defined in later sections.

  ## Subscribing routers

  Often you will want one router to become a sink to another
  router and vice-versa. This can be done with the `subscribe/2`
  function, which tells the router to ask a given source for
  data, similar to the example shown above:

      {:ok, ref} = GenRouterx.subscribe(sink, to: source)

  Subscription returns a pid and a reference. The reference can
  be given to unsubscribe from the sink:

      GenRouterx.unsubscribe(sink, ref)

  Or to cancel directly in the source:

      GenRouterx.cancel(source, ref)

  ## Flow control

  The reason why the sink must ask for data is to provide
  flow control and alternate between push and pull.

  If the sink is faster than the source, it can ask for
  large chunks of data, which the source ends-up sending
  at will, working as if it was simply pushing data.

  However, if the sink is slower than the source, explicitly
  asking for data makes it a pull system, where the source
  needs to wait before sending more data to the sink. If
  the difference is large, the source should then buffer
  up to some point and then start loadshedding or drop the
  sink.

  The messages between source and sink are as follows:

    * `{:"$gen_ask", {pid, ref}, {count, options}}` -
      used to ask data from a source. Once this message is
      received, the source MUST monitor the sink and emit
      data up to the counter. Following messages will
      increase the counter kept by the source.

    * `{:"$gen_notify", {pid, ref}, [event]}` -
      used to send data to a sink. The third argument is a
      non-empty list of events. The `ref` is the same used
      when asked for the data.

    * `{:"$gen_ask", {pid, ref}, {:cancel, options}}` -
      cancels the current source/sink relationship. The source
      MUST send a reply (detailed below), even if it does not
      know the given reference. However there is no guarantee
      the message will be received (for example, the source
      may crash just before sending the confirmation). For
      such, it is recomended for the source to be monitored.

    * `{:"$gen_notify", {pid, ref}, {:eos, reason}}` -
      signals the end of the "event stream". Reason may
      be `:done`, `:halted`, `:cancelled` or even `{:error,
      reason}` (in case `handle_up/2` returns error).

  Note those messages are not tied to GenRouterx at all.
  The GenRouterx is just one of the many processes that
  implement the message format defined above.

  ### Overflow

  As mentioned above, if one of the sinks cannot ask for messages
  as fast as they are arriving, the system becomes pull, with the
  sink asking the source for data.

  Everytime this happens, `handle_overflow/2` is invoked with the
  sink reference. This allows the router to react to unexpected
  overflows. For example, in case of the router above, one could
  remove the slow sink from the list of processes.

  After `handle_overflow/2` is called, one of `handle_up/2` or
  `handle_down/3` will eventually be called. The first when the
  sink asks for more data, the second if the sink crashes or
  cancels its subscription.

  In order to avoid overflow to be triggered multiple times, it
  is recommended for sinks to work with a window of messages.
  For example, instead of asking for 20 messages and then asking
  for 20 more messages when the original 20 messages are received,
  it is preferred to ask for 20 messages and ask for more when
  the first 10 messages (i.e. 50% of the quota) are processed.

  ### Load shedding or postponing

  When dispatching to a sink that has overflown, the router will
  stop dispatching until the sink asks for more messages.

  In some occasions, you may choose to act differenty, either by
  simply discarding messages (load shedding) or by postponing
  dispatching until one or more sinks are ready for receiving data.

  Load shedding can be done by:

      # TODO: Example

  Postponing can be achieved by:

      # TODO: Example

  In fact, postponing can be used to hold on dispatching messages
  until a sink is connect. For example:

      # TODO: Example

  ## Name Registration

  GenRouterx processes are bound to the same name registration rules
  as `GenServer`. Read more about it in the `GenServer` docs.
