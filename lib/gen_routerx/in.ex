  Called when the router is about to terminate, useful for cleaning up.

  It must return `:ok`. If part of a supervision tree, terminate only gets
  called if the router is set to trap exits using `Process.flag/2` *and*
  the shutdown strategy of the Supervisor is a timeout value, not `:brutal_kill`.
  The callback is also not invoked if links are broken unless trapping exits.
  For such reasons, we usually recommend important clean-up rules to happen
  in separated processes either by use of monitoring or by links themselves.
